Up to late yesterday, a senior police officer said 44-year-old Gail Harripersad\\u2019s claims of assault were being investigated.\\nPolice said a 47-year-old man was expected to be detained. Harripersad decided to make a public plea for rescue from the hands of a \\u201cdemon\\u201d before it is too late. Yesterday, Newsday\\u2019s south office was bombarded with telephone calls as many groups called to offer their assistance and support to her.  President of the International Women\\u2019s Resource Network (IWRN) Adriana Sandrine Rattan said the group was disheartened on reading about Harripersad\\u2019s story in the Newsday. \\u201cHowever, what we are happy about is that she spoke out. And that is one of the issues we are crying out for \\u2013 abuse victims not to keep silent, but find some way to raise a red flag. So maybe the media or NGOs can reach out and help them,\\u201d Rattan said.\\nShe said when victims find someone they can trust, then they can work together to find a way to develop an exit strategy from the situation. Members of the Coalition Against Domestic Violence, TT Coalition Against Domestic Violence  and other groups echoed similar sentiments.\\nSpeaking with Newsday yesterday, Harripersad said she was happy she broke her silence. \\u201cI am so thankful for the support of all these groups. I have gotten so many calls yesterday and I feel that they are all there standing by  me. I want other women out there to take a stand, speak out,\\u201d she said.\\n\\u201cNo woman or man should be treated worse than an animal like I was treated. I am  not ashamed to say I am an abused woman, violence against women must stop. I am so thankful to  my daughter Abigail for encouraging me to be brave and speak up.\\u201d\\nHarripersad said now all she is praying for is justice and to \\u201cfeel safe again in her home\\u201d.  On Monday night, with the assistance of her daughter Abigail Coldero, she broke her silence and shared her story in post via Facebook. The post has since been shared over 4,000 times. Harripersad told Newsday yesterday that last year the physical abuse increased drastically. She was hospitalised on three occasions with injuries to her face, head, chest and eyes. Last year November, Harripersad said, she received what she described as \\u201cone of the worst beatings\\u201d.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_from_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2018-02-08 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2018-02-08 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2018-02-08 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Up until a short while ago the workers led by branch president Ahmad Mohammad, were still outside the office waiting on the GM who asked for time to confer with management, before addressing them. Mohammad said the cement workers who turned out for the 6.15 am prayer meeting at the Claxton Bay compound , became incensed when they learnt that the company blanked a confirmed meeting with the OWTU scheduled for 10 am at Paramount Building, San Fernando yesterday to discuss and find a resolution to proposed redundancy at the company . Mohammad said the union and executive waited but the meeting never came off. Instead the company sent a letter stating it was not prepared to discuss any items listed, except redundancy. When this was conveyed to the workers this morning, they abandoned their prayer meeting, at the company's entrance, marched to the administration offices and made their demands. Mohammad said the workers did not storm the office but were merely exercising their legitimate right to access the office and seek an audience with their general manager.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

The distributed seeds, sourced from the Corporate Republic of Guyana (Republic Bank Guyana), come as part of a $2 million allocation by the ministry to revitalise local food production. The seeds are expected to support the commercial planting of approximately 2,000 acres of land. \\u201cIn 2014, TT produced approximately 2,800 metric tonnes of rice paddy,\\u201d said Agriculture Minister Ravi Ratiram at the distribution ceremony at the Central Experiment Station, Centeno on May 20. \\u201cThat figure fell to 600 metric tonnes in 2018 and the decline has been sharp and sustained. In 2023, according to the Finance Ministry\\u2019s Review of the Economy, production fell to 445 metric tonnes. \\u201cAnd the consequences are real. Greater dependence on inputs, decreased exposure to local supply shops and vulnerabilities to fluctuating prices. At present TT imports over 90 per cent of its rice, mostly from Guyana and the US spending millions annually.\\u201d Raritam said the import situation was not only economically inefficient but strategically risky in the light of climate change, fluctuating shipping costs and regional production pressures.

Ratiram said the ministry was currently assessing what needs to be done to enhance farming infrastructure, which he said was neglected by the previous administration. \\u201cThis is a whole-of-government and whole-of-sector effort. \\u201cTo our farmers, the most valued and important stakeholders in this conversation, you are the centre of this transformation. We are here, not just to support you with inputs but to engage you as strategic partners. You know the land, you know the labour, you know the risks and you also know what is possible when the right conditions are in place.\\u201d Ratiram thanked Guyana\\u2019s Agriculture Minister Zulfikar Mustapha and the Guyana consulate for supporting the initiative.\",\n          \"ATTORNEYS representing Niegel Subiah, a senior executive at the Point Lisas Industrial Port Development Corporation Ltd (Plipdeco), have raised serious concerns about alleged political interference, misuse of public funds, and administrative misconduct at the state enterprise. The letter, addressed to Plipdeco chairman Annette Wattie and issued by Freedom Law Chambers, led by Anand Ramlogan, SC, accuses the current board of pursuing a politically motivated agenda following the change in government in April. The letter calls on the chairman and the board\\u2014appointed by the former PNM administration\\u2014to resign. Attorney Robert Abdool-Mitchell accused the current board of lacking corporate legitimacy. He also alleged breaches of public trust. The letter said Subiah, vice-president - business services, who was sent on administrative leave effective May 3 to June 2, has rejected an invitation to attend a disciplinary meeting scheduled for June 2 to discuss his status regarding administrative leave and disciplinary charges. His legal team insisted that the board no longer holds the moral or legal authority to conduct such proceedings. \\u201cOur client has no desire to participate in a meeting with someone who is clinging to the office of chairman in circumstances where it is abundantly clear that you should have tendered your resignation,\\u201d the letter said. According to the attorneys, Wattie's appointment in October 2024, following the departure of former chairman Daniel Dookie, was politically motivated. The letter alleged that public funds were used to purchase party fete tickets totalling $20,400, which has reportedly prompted complaints to the Integrity Commission. The attorneys also allege that several senior executives, including Dr Averne Pantin, Richelle Lyman, and Subiah, were placed on administrative leave under questionable circumstances. Procurement officials were similarly removed after reportedly raising concerns about procurement practices at the organisation. In an extensive breakdown, the letter outlines several areas where Plipdeco allegedly suffered significant revenue losses. These included a $18 million loss related to discounts at the ISCOTT dock;$16 million in unpaid port fees due to credit arrangements; $16 million in demurrage losses; $7 million in unresolved auction proceeds;$16 million in under-priced shipping contracts; $3.6 million in estate lease discrepancies; and $600,000 lost in a discontinued logistics venture. The letter said these concerns were reportedly brought to the attention of the current board, but steps have been taken to remove or sideline those raising the alarm. The attorneys argue that in keeping with political convention, the board should have resigned following the election of the new United National Congress (UNC)-led government under Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar on April 28. At a post-Cabinet briefing on May 29, Prime Minister Persad-Bissessar stated, \\u201cI want to tell all boards who are refusing to resign\\u2026 we are calling upon them to do the right thing.\\u201d The letter also claims that new internal postings and procurement plans, \\u2014including the planned purchase of an X-ray scanner allegedly tied to a former executive\\u2019s spouse,raise additional concerns and warrant further investigation. \\u201cOur client has evidence of political corruption, waste and mismanagement in his possession which he intends to reveal to the newly appointed board,\\u201d the letter said. It also provided internal e-mails to support the claims made.Jared Jagroo also represents Subiah.\",\n          \"ACTING chief education officer Aaron Ramrattan has said there were approximately 77 reports of bullying in primary schools and 470 in secondary schools from 2022-2024. He also said there is no need to put police officers in schools to protect students and teachers against criminals, there are crime hot spots in all education districts and there is no evidence that criminal gangs are operating in schools. He spoke at a public meeting between Education Ministry officials and members of the Parliament's Social Services and Public Administration Joint Select Committee (JSC) on November 27. Ramrattan agreed with Opposition Senator David Nakhid that bullying in schools is under-reported in some cases. Nakhid asked about reported cases of bullying in schools. After Ramrattan provided this information, Nakhid asked, \\\"What is the ministry doing to address that staggering rise (sic) from 77 to 470?\\\" Ramrattan said student councils and home periods, where students can discuss their problems with their form teachers, are some of the ways in which bullying is addressed in schools. Victims, he said, can report bullying incidents to the form teacher or the school's dean. Ramrattan said, \\\"A preliminary investigation is done with regard to the incident and certain actions are taken in terms of investigating to find out exactly the nature of the incident.\\\" He added follow-up action could involve a conference between the student's parents and teacher. JSC chairman Independent Senator Dr Paul Richards asked what parents could do if they believe these efforts are unsuccessful. Ramrattan said they had the option of reporting the matter to the district's school supervisor. \\\"The Ministry of Education is very concerned about every single incident. Sometimes it is unfortunate that it hits social media before the school gets a chance to address it properly.\\\" He added that when this happens, it does not mean the school is not addressing the situation. Ramrattan said while the numbers look large, the number of bullying incidents in schools is on the decline. Planning and Development Minister Pennelope Beckles-Robinson asked about the partnership between the Education and National Security ministries to protect students and teachers in schools in crime hot spots from violence and criminal gang activity. Richards said, \\\"I don't know what is described as a hot spot area in these times, because hot spot locations have changed over the years in this country.\\\" Ramrattan said school principals report incidents of violence near schools and the ministry uses additional information to advise the National Security Ministry about schools which need more police patrols. He added that that ministry has been given a list of these schools. Richards asked if there are more police officers patrolling the area around these schools or officers being placed in them. Ramrattan said schools have National Maintenance Training and Service (MTS) security officer based there, and because of this, there is no \\\"need for a police officer in the school compound.\\\" When Ramrattan said there were crime hot spots in all seven of the country's education districts, Richards replied, \\\"That is frightening.\\\" He asked if the ministry has received reports of primary school students, ages nine-14, being members of criminal gangs. Ramrattan said, \\\"I can't say officially that we have any reports of gangs in our school system. \\\"Sometimes when things do happen on the outside it is alleged that this student is involved (in crime).\\\" Richards told Education Ministry officials about reports about nine-14-year-old students in primary schools allegedly \\\"extorting their peers or attempting to extort their peers.\\\" He related a story told to him about an incident in a school in Port of Spain. \\\"A teacher was told by a student, 'Don't tell me nothing, my father is a gang member and you go get mash up.'\\\" Richards asked what teachers do when they receive such threats. Ramrattan said in those circumstances, the teacher would report the matter to the principal and then a report is made to the police.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"date_from_url\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2024-11-27 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2025-11-22 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 361,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2025-05-09 00:00:00\",\n          \"2024-12-30 00:00:00\",\n          \"2024-12-12 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
